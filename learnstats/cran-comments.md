## Notes 
This is an updated submission of what was originally submitted as "stats250." Reviewer comments for the previous submission were: "This is not a package of general interest, and the version number is long and mainly redundant. You would need to make a very strong case for it to be considered to CRAN, and describe it much less parochially."
These concerns have been addressed. The version name is more succinct, and the focus of this package is now broader statistical education using base R and shiny to provide an interactive learning environment. The new name of the package is consistent with these broader purposes.
I have also changed the description per CRAN feedback, and I have updated the submission date.
