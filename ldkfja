[32m+[m[32mThis is an updated submission of what was originally submitted as "stats250." Reviewer comments for the previous submission were: "This is not a package of general interest, and the version number is long and mainly redundant. You would need to make a very strong case for it to be considered to CRAN, and describe it much less parochially."[m
[32m+[m
[32m+[m[32mThese concerns have been addressed. The version name is more succinct, and the focus of this package is now broader statistical education using base R and shiny to provide an interactive learning environment. The new name of the package is consistent with these broader purposes.[m
